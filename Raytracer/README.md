This project is a backward raytracer written in C++ with OpenGL.

The parts that I wrote are split across multiple files.

In Project3.cpp -- render loop

In scene.cpp -- rayTrace and transmissionRayTrace functions

For sphere.cpp and triangle.cpp -- testIntersection, getSurfacePoint, getNormal, getTextureCoords functions
and for just triangle.cpp -- getBarycentricCoords
